# Interconnected-Racing-Gambling-Game
This horse racing game provides interconnectivity among 5 users who endure simultaneous race animations and results. Developed using JavaScript, PHP and AJAX.
The objective of this project was to create a game whereby multiple users could log in to an account, all users partake in a randomly generated horse race and stake in game money on a particular horse and one user would end up the winner and claim the winnings. I wanted to create the connectivity between users and allow them to all share the same game experience while on the same server.
